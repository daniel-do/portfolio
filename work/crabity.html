            <p>Crabity is a 2D/3D puzzle platformer co-op game where the players are robot crabs navigating through levels to find a rocket that will allow them to return back to Earth! With seemingly impossible levels, the player needs to change their perspective and harness the power of gravity to gain access to previously unreachable platforms.</p>
            <p>During the design phase of our project, I worked on level design that involved intricately integrating the mechanics of camera rotation to create cohesive and engaging gameplay experiences. I also developed the key and door logic to follow the player once collected and to then enable the exit to be accessed. Additionally, I contributed to designing and delivering a total of four presentations with slides that showcased Crabity's ten week-long development and progress stages. During the final week of designing and developing our vertical slice, I put together a vertical slice shortplay trailer along with its longplay video component that emphasizes Crabityâ€™s in-game experience. Lastly, I came up with Crabity's main concept of a puzzle-rotating platformer game. I essentially catered all of my contributions towards the visual, polish, and game feel side of Crabity.</p>
