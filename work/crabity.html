            <p>Crabity is a puzzle platformer where the player controls a small robot attempting to escape the long dormant facility it has been bound to. Initially, the game is presented in a two-dimensional format, however not all is as it seems. By rotating the camera, the entire level will shift, revealing paths and secrets that were previously invisible. You have also been gifted with advanced gravity manipulation technology; given these gifts, you must shift the world around you and explore every avenue if there is any hope of escape.</p>
            <p>I worked on level design that involved intricately integrating the mechanics of camera rotation to create cohesive and engaging gameplay experiences. I also developed the key and door logic to follow the player once collected and to then enable the exit to be accessed. Additionally, I contributed to designing and delivering a total of four presentations with slides that showcased Crabity's ten week-long development and progress stages. During the final week of designing and developing our vertical slice, I put together a vertical slice shortplay trailer along with its longplay video component that emphasizes Crabityâ€™s in-game experience. Lastly, I came up with Crabity's main concept of a puzzle-rotating platformer game. I essentially catered all of my contributions towards the visual, polish, and game feel side of Crabity.</p>
