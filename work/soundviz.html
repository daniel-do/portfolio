            <p>An application that consists of one audio visualizer that is able to toggle between layers to see the different effects that audio can make. There are implementations of upload, download, and various audio control functionalities to act as a music player that allows the user to play music and enjoy the beautiful art that unfolds in front of them. Watch and be immersed in my creative art show piece as SoundViz comes to life!</p>
            <p>In this project made by five students, I worked on creating two layers for our audio visualizer that consisted of using particles and shapes, which were modified based on the current sound being played. I also worked on the visual and functionality of a menu palette that users can toggle and untoggle layers, through clicking buttons, of our overall visualizer, which created a more interactable experience. For me, a definite low was focusing a lot of my efforts towards code readability and efficiency; optimizing portions of code that were either repeated or unclear of its functionality. This is because, at times, our code had variables and functions that affected other visualizer layers and were tedious to manage, but it was definitely a satisfying end result. A high would have to be our end audio visualizer result looking almost exactly like our original concept of my paper prototype.</p>

            <div id="text">
              <p>In crafting our project, we aimed to make controlled chaos through our individuality by having each layer serve as an example of our individual expression. We sought to make a fusion of manipulating layers of visuals that are influenced by sound and manipulating the sound itself to create artistic chaos through individuality. Our project stands to be a testament to embrace the diversity of artistic intent amidst the chaos.</p>
              <p>We were inspired by using the sound library from p5.js and some of the examples that were shown in the lectures. Some of which represent ideas that we used in our final version of the project. For example, we were inspired by using the sound library to influence visuals based on the frequency of the music.</p>
              <p>These examples were used as inspiration from the lectures on sound art as a starting point. We did not replicate the code but we admired the concepts held within these examples and thought about how we could create emergent art through likewise algorithms.</p>
