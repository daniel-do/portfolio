            <p>SoundViz is about having one audio visualizer that is able to toggle between layers to see the different effects that audio can make. We have implemented upload, download, and various audio control functionalities to act as a music player that allows the user to play music and enjoy the beautiful art that unfolds in front of them. Watch and be immersed in our creative art show piece as our project, SoundViz, comes to life!</p>
            <p>In this project, I worked on creating two layers for our audio visualizer that consisted of using particles and shapes, which were modified based on the current sound being played. I also worked on the visual and functionality of a menu palette that users can toggle and untoggle layers, through clicking buttons, of our overall visualizer, which created a more interactable experience. For me, a definite low was focusing a lot of my efforts towards code readability and efficiency; optimizing portions of code that were either repeated or unclear of its functionality. This is because, at times, our code had variables and functions that affected other visualizer layers and were tedious to manage, but it was definitely a satisfying end result. A high would have to be our end audio visualizer result looking almost exactly like our original concept of my paper prototype.</p>
