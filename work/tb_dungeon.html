          <div id="text">
            <p>TB Dungeon (or Turn-Based Dungeon) is a dungeon crawler-like game somewhat inspired by JRPGS.
                The main character moves through WASD movement and will have to defeat enemies through
                turn-based combat and loot items in order to complete the game. Monochromatic sprites
                and assets are mostly used except for the main playable character that stands
                out from the rest. Aside from the title, credits, and controls scene, the game takes place within
                a single level. The game ends when the player successfully kills all the enemies in the
                dungeon and a new room appears. This room leads to a boss enemy that the player must defeat for the game to end.
                Collectibles are scattered around the map that can restore their health.</p>
            <p>Uses Phaser 3 and Tiled.</p>

          <div id="text">
            <p>Use WASD to move the character</p>
            <p>Press ‘1’ to select ‘Fire’ in combat, ‘2’ for ‘Water’, and ‘3’ for ‘Grass’</p>
            <p>Players start with 5 health</p>
            <p>Touch one of the potions lying around to restore 1 HP</p>
            <p>In order to move to the boss chamber after defeating all 5 small enemies in the initial room, walk towards the right hand side and touch the staircase that appears. It will be invisible before all the enemies have been defeated.</p>
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 5%">Combat System</p>
          <div id="text">
            <p>We successfully implemented a combat system that functions similarly to rock-paper-scissors using the elements of fire, water, and grass. The player picks one of the three, and then the computer randomly picks one for the enemy, then calculates the outcome. A loss subtracts one from the player’s health.</p>
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 5%">Dialogue and Pop-ups</p>
          <div id="text">
            <p>Starting combat by interacting with an enemy creates a pop-up screen, which changes whether the player wins, loses, or ties with their opponent. We also implemented a quest bar at the bottom of the screen, which helps tell the player what they need to do to proceed with the game.</p>
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 5%">Sprite animation</p>
          <div id="text">
            <p>All three of our main character sprites (the player’s wizard, the pirate enemies, and the boss ghost) have animations that contain 4 frames each.</p>
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 5%">Sounds and VFX</p>
          <div id="text">
            <p>Background music plays throughout the main game and switches for the boss chamber. Combat has sound effects to enhance the experience. VFX were added to improve the player’s running animation.</p>
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 5%">Enemy movement and spawn</p>
          <div id="text">
            <p>Enemies and collectibles spawn at random locations across the map, so no two playthroughs are the same. While they don’t move particularly far, the enemies move randomly within a small radius around themselves. Touching an enemy initiates combat.</p>
