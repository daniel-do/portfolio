            <p>Advance through various levels upgrading from a seed into a tree as you save the world from pollution and global warming. Dash left and right, collect falling raindrops, and dodge endless hordes of predators and pollutants! Will you help our treant thrive in this environment?</p>
            <p>In Tree Man Game, a narrative-strategy game, players take control of a unique protagonist: a treant, a mythical tree-like creature. The game's objective is simple but challenging: catch friendly rain and dodge hostile projectiles (i.e., banana slug, pollutants) falling from the sky to earn as many points as possible. As the projectiles fall down from above, creating an obstacle course that requires quick reflexes and strategic maneuvering, players must guide the treant by tapping the cursor keys, making it dodge left or right to avoid (or catch) the incoming projectiles.</p>
            <p>The game features various types of projectiles, each with randomized behavior and speed. Players need to analyze the patterns and timing of the projectiles to anticipate their movements and successfully navigate through the obstacles. Successful mastery of these simple mechanics allows the player to progress through the story much faster. Alternatively, the player can progress through the narrative at any pace they please through the use of replayability.</p>
            <p>The game offers several levels with varied level designs, background art, and progressing system. Each level will provide players with unique experiences with different obstacles and varied difficulties. As the player progresses through levels, starting from a dry desert to a thriving rainforest filled with plants, the treant becomes stronger through the use of an upgrade system. This system will allow the players to make unique strategic decisions based on their own subjective initiatives. Upgrades include the ability (i.e., character patching) to move faster, become tougher, or get more efficiency in collecting rain. There will be upgrades that can help you speed up the process of collecting rain and can offer protection as well. In order to progress to the next level, the player would need to collect a certain amount of rain. This simulates the real world where an environment needs a sustainable amount of rain in order to thrive.</p>
            <p>The experiential/emotional goals of this game are to emphasize the importance of protecting wildlife from pollution and other dangers as well as raise peopleâ€™s awareness of the current environmental issues happening in this world. We want the player to feel saddened by the barren landscapes, then relieved and excited to see the luscious forests they built and protected along the way. We also want the game to feel a little bit like a grind since it requires a lot of hard work to protect and save the environment from the dangers we create.</p>
            <p>With its charming treant protagonist, intuitive controls, and addictive gameplay, thisnarrative-strategy game offers an entertaining experience for players of all ages.</p>
